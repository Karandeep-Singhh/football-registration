<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Football Registration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36320943/152296207-0230bedf-7700-4749-b609-71a69ed996fe.png)

Preparing a Football Registration Form in which the user will be able to enter various details to register for a Football tournament.

What's inside:

- The user will be required to input various details such as "First name", "Email", "Desired position", etc.
- After submitting the form, a message will show up that the form has been submitted and then repopulate data in the form for the user to edit the fields.
- After retrieval, if the user edits any field and submit, then the already existing entries in the database are updated. Finally a message that the form has been updated is shown.

Of course, a lot of other things are there, but will know more about them later ðŸ˜‰
